# MATCHA
Matcha is a Tinder-like app realized in Node.js and React, using Express Framework and a MySql database. It allows you to complete a detailed profile and to meet new people close to you thanks to geolocation. We've also integrated other factors in our algorithm to connect people, such as age and interests. When two people match together, they can talk in real time in our chat, thanks to Socket.io. We've used MDBReact and Ant-design to style our app. Our website is fully responsive.

It's the second web project of 42 School and I realized it with @dcirlig.

Don't hesitate to contact me if you have any question!
